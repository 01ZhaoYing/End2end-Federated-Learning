A demo of end-to-end federated learning system.

[中文版本](https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/End2end-Federated-Learning/blob/main/README_CN.md)

## Introduce

Federated learning gets a lot of attention recently, but the existing work is basically based on simulation testing, and there is no complete system for everyone to study. Therefore, we built an end-to-end cross-terminal federated learning system and tested it on 20 real Android devices（demo below）. The code will be actively maintained and optimized, and hope it is useful for open source comunity.
